  The <a href="https://hedera.com/consensus-service">Hashgraph</a> is a consensus algorithm managed and sustained by the <a href="https://hedera.com/council">Hedera Organization</a>. 
  We implemented a Javascript code using Hedera's Javascript library. We intend to to test the Hashgraph performance as parte of an academic assignment at UQAC, more specifically in the 
  subject of Design/architecture of cloud computing systems.
